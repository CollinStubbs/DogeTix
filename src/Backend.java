 * This is the backend of our ticket system, DogeTix.
 * It reads in the previous days User Accounts file and 
 * Available Tickets File and then applies all transactions
 * from a merged set of daily transaction files to these files 
 * Then it produces a new Current User Accounts File and new 
 * Available Tickets File for the next front end run
